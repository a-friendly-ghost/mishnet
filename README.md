haiii!! this is mishie!! c:

this is mishnet! a bot that creates a shared channel between multiple servers! it's still being worked on!
mishnet is being developed by me (mishie c:) and linus

here's a list of the current progress:

finished and working!:
- bridging
- images
- gifs
- videos
- replies*
- double replies*
- editing*
- deleting*
- deleting webhook messages with a :x: react*
*to messages sent after the last bot restart

not coded yet:
- message database
  - which will allow all replies, editing, and deleting to work on messages sent before the last bot restart
- reactions (not even sure yet how we'll do this)

this will be updated as the bot is developed :D
